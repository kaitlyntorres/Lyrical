# Objective
Our goal was to create an app where users could search for a song using voice or text input

# Usage
Users can run this app by opening it in android studio or side loading it on an android device

# Guide
Users will be greeted upon launching of the app. From there they will be asked to login, create an account, or continue as a guest.
Once they choose an avenue of login, they will be at the home page where they can query a song or view their history.
Users will have the option to query songs by voice input or by text input. Users can also choose language support for the voice search.
Once users enter a verse from their song, the app will query up to 10 results from spotify and display it for listening on the player. From there,
users can confirm or deny if the song is correct. If the song is marked correct, it will be added to the history and teh user will be
returned to the home page. If it is marked as incorrect, the next song in the queue will be pulled. Users can logout when they are done.
